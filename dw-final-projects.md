#### Mystery and Fantasy
- Liv D - [Who Killed Miss Jones?](https://livdelesantis.github.io/digital-writing-twine/)

In 'Who Killed Miss Jones?', the small, rural Victorian town of Sentry Creek is brimming with dirty secrets. It's been 40 years since the unexplained disappearance of school-teacher Daphne Marie Jones. Playing as a cold-case detective, you are sent from the Metropolitan Police to re-examine four eyewitness accounts - provided by four teenage girls around the time of Daphne's disappearance. You must solve riddles upon riddles, dissect lies and discover hidden clues to answer the titular question: Who Killed Miss Jones? And more importantly...why? A world of psychological horror, disturbing twists and eerily authentic characters await. Who is lying to you, who is telling the truth? Can you find the correct answer and solve the decades-long mystery?

Insomnomania is a 51-passage Twine-based interactive fiction. Its story revolves
around a surrealist representation of loss, experienced through the lens of an
insomniac protagonist. Set in Utrecht, Netherlands the unnamed, potentially
unreliable, narrator passes between reality and unreality as figures, sounds and
colours recur, leading him through his psyche to self-actualisation.

The Tank is an interactive digital work created in Twine, tracing a protagonist's journey through their family's village in Southern Italy. Written in second person, it weaves between present-day experiences of visiting Santo Todaro for the first time and memories passed down through generations, using family photographs, soundscape, and interactive elements to explore what it means to return to a place you've never been but have experienced through inheritance.
