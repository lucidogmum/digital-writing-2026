# COMM2651 Sem 1 2026. Digital Writing Weekly Class Notes

Refer to this page for week-to-week activities. The syllabus, key readings and assessment outlines can be found in the [class handbook](/class-handbook.md)  


## To prepare for Week 1

In addition to what is on [Reading List](https://rmit.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/61RMIT_INST/lists/57980087760001341?auth=SAML) have a play around in the following works of E-Lit:

1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

### Break 

### Assessment overview 

### Exercise: set up GitHub account and digital-writing-folio

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Do the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Once you have done this create a public repository called `digital-writing-folio` with a `README` (tick box yes). Add a GNU General Public, Apache 2.0 or MIT Licence. 

On the main page of the repository you will see a button called "Add file".

1. Select "Add file"
2. Select "Create new file" from the dropdown that appears
3. At the top where you can see "Name your file..." type in `swift-reflections.md`
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Commit new file"
5. Repeat the above steps to add `class-exercises-and-project-iteration.md`

Look at the [example digital writing folio](https://github.com/lucidogmum/digital-writing-folio). This should give you an idea of what the folio should initially look like.

When writing in your folio you will use the plaintext formatting code called **markdown** You can read the reference here for this [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

On the example digital writing folio click on the "README.md" and then the CODE tab. On the far right you should see a button that looks like "<>". Select that button to see the **markdown** formatting tags on the page. You can follow this technique for all the pages to see the formatting used. 

### swift-reflection - 15 mins
Edit the `swift-reflections.md` page you just created in your digital writing folio and respond to these questions: 

- What makes a work a piece E-Literature?
- Of the key examples above, which did you like most and why? 
- What do you expect from this class? What would you like to be better at by the end of semester? 

### final task (can do after class): edit `README.md` in your new folio. Add a biographical note by answering the following questions:
- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write? Why do you use them?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain or generate)?
- What are curious about writing in the digital environment?  

## Thursday.
