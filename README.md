- [Class handbook](/class-handbook.md)


## Reminder - Drop-in Sessions

Jenny and Lucinda will have an open drop in Teams video meeting each Wednesday 5.15-6.15pm for consultation outside class via [this link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MGJkZTA3ZGEtODRjZS00ZmY4LWFmZDQtNGFhMDU5NWFmNTE5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%221d10c7bf-efc3-4712-b85f-2b383cf17eea%22%7d).

## To prepare for Week 1

Read (in addition to what is on Reading List):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

Familiarise yourself with the following student resources as well as the Student Charter:

# Week 1 - for use in class

## Wednesday. 

### Introduction to the course, Syllabus overview 

### Digital Writing - what is it?

- Explore key examples
- The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
- The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
- The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
- The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

Class discussion: What makes each work a piece of digital writing? What is your personal response - do you like it? why/why not?

### Electronic Literature. Defining e-lit
- [The Electronic Literature Collections](https://collection.eliterature.org/)
- Notes on Key Readings 

## Break 

### Assessment overview 

### Exercise 

### Set up GitHub account and digital-writing-folio

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Do the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Once you have done this create a public repository called `digital-writing-folio` with a `README` (tick box yes). Add a GNU General Public, Apache 2.0 or MIT Licence. 

On the main page of the repository you will see a button called "Add file".

1. Select "Add file"
2. Select "Create new file" from the dropdown that appears
3. At the top where you can see "Name your file..." type in `swift-reflections.md`
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Commit new file"
5. Repeat the above steps to add `class-exercises-and-project-iteration.md`

Look at the [example digital writing folio](https://github.com/lucidogmum/digital-writing-folio). This should give you an idea of what the folio should initially look like.

When writing in your folio you will use the plaintext formatting code called **markdown** You can read the reference here for this [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

On the example digital writing folio click on the "README.md" and then the CODE tab. On the far right you should see a button that looks like "<>". Select that button to see the **markdown** formatting tags on the page. You can follow this technique for all the pages to see the formatting used. 

### swift-reflection - 15 mins
Edit the `swift-reflections.md` page you just created in your digital writing folio and respond to these questions: 

- What makes a work a piece E-Literature?
- Of the key examples above, which did you like most and why? 
- What do you expect from this class? What would you like to be better at by the end of semester? 

Edit the `README.md` Add a biographical note by answering the following questions:
- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write? Why do you use them?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain or generate)?
- What are curious about writing in the digital environment?  

## Thursday. 

### Intro to the Coding Playground

- Create an account on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) using your GitHub login credentials
- Remix this code: [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground)

---

If you missed out on the first week of classes, please make sure that you have set up a GitHub account and that you follow the exercises above including Hello World (if you get lost, find a YouTube tutorial) and setting up your digital writing folio. Make sure that you're familiar with the documentation in this GitHub repository including the [class handbook](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/class-handbook.md), and that you are up to date on the class readings. Also be sure to share your GitHub username with Jenny and Lucinda if you have not done so already.

# Week 2 - for use in class

This Wednesday we will be working in the [coding playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground) that you began to remix last week. 

If you missed out on the first week of classes, please make sure that you have set up a GitHub account, have signed into Glitch.com using your GitHub credentials so that the accounts are linked, that you follow the exercises above including Hello World (if you get lost, find a YouTube tutorial) and setting up your Digital Writing folio, that you're familiar with the documentation in this GitHub repository including the [class handbook](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/class-handbook.md), and that you are up to date on the class readings. Also be sure to share your GitHub username with Jenny and Lucinda if you have not done so already.

In class this week we will learn step-by-step how to make changes to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will learn to import fonts of your choosing into the stylesheet; how to edit text, emojis and images; how to set background colours and apply various style changes. You will also learn how to edit textual arrays in order to fuel combinatory poetry which is pseudo-randomly generated. You are not expected to know how to do any of these things yet. If you have to miss out on this Wednesday class for any reason, then you should spend at least a few hours completing [free coding tutorials](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-basic-website.md#free-resources-for-learning-web-development) such as Codeacademy and FreeCodeCamp.

Here are some miscellaneous resources that you will find helpful as we code today:

- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Hex colour codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) 
- Check if your [colour contrast is accessible](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [Royalty-free images](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Emojis](https://tools.picsart.com/text/emojis/)
- [GIFs](https://giphy.com/)
- [ChatGPT for troubleshooting code](https://chat.openai.com/)

# Week 3 - for use in class

## Monday 17th March

This Monday we will finish working in the [coding playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground) which we remixed. In class, we will remix the last three poems, as follows, then publish our coding playgrounds via GitHub Pages. 

It is important that you engage with these exercises, as Jenny and Lucinda will expect to see these published experiments when you submit your folio at the end of semester, which forms half of your marks. It is important to document your learning and your engagement with coding, as you figure out the technical possibilities for what your final project will look like. Even if you choose not to go with HTML/CSS/JS for your project, it is the most basic programming syntax which fuels nearly every online literary journal and is therefore worth being exposed to. If you do not yet have an author website - another requirement of the folio - building one on Glitch and publishing it on GitHub Pages is a simple and free mode of fulfilling this requirement. There will be further opportunities later in the semester to build author sites.

If you are absent from class, be sure to complete the following exercises that we will do in Monday's class:

- The 'Garfield' poem is a form of combinatory poetry that operates within a constraint. In this case, clicking the 'remix' button results in the placeholder text being replaced with three haikus. These haikus are populated from arrays of poetic phrases that are five syllables long - from the `const fiveSyllables =` array in the script.js file - and seven syllables long - from the `const sevenSyllables =` array. Edit these arrays to make haiku of your own, enclosingou will each line of five or seven syllables within parenthesis, followed by a single comma. Next be sure to change the placeholder text in the index.html file in the `<div class="cardHaiku">` area. Also be sure to apply new style properties (font, font colour, background colour, etc.) in the corresponding `.cardHaiku` class on the style.css file. 
- The 'SEARCHING' poem is a way to play with the auto-complete function of a search engine. Inspect your own browser history, or turn to Google or another search engine, to investigate a particular topic. You can either follow your own interests or exploit Google's autocomplete function to create your own database of search results - just make sure that you have at least one result for every letter of the alphabet. You will enclose each line of search results within parenthesis, followed by a single comma, in the `const words =` array on the script.js file. Test it out by typing a single letter in the website preview, in the search box.
- The 'Dystopian Dreams' poem is modified from a digital poetry exercise created by Benjamin Laird, which modified code from Nick Monfort's seminal [Taroko Gorge](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/) which has famously been remixed again and again. Under `<div class="cardPoem">` on the index.html file, give the poem a new title. Then on the script.js file, edit the words or phrases within the `const subjects =`, `verbs` and `objects` arrays. Unlike the previous two exercises which required you to format each word or phrase like `"this example",`, this time the `.split` function is used as a shortcut, which allows you to simply separate phrases in the array with a comma.

Once you have finished these exercises, be sure to click TOOLS -> IMPORT/EXPORT -> EXPORT TO GITHUB then put in your username/repositoryname to push your changes to your GitHub repository. Then, once in GitHub, view that repository and follow the green buttons: COMPARE & PULL REQUEST, CREATE PULL REQUEST, MERGE PULL REQUEST, CONFIRM MERGE.

Next we will publish our code on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site). You can follow the instructions in the link or follow along in class. *Jenny will clarfify this in class Monday Week 4 there was a bug in the process.

Finally, let's reflect on our remixed versions of Nick Monfort's poems. Edit the edit `exercises.md` page in your GitHub digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions:

- What aspects of the remix are the same?
- What aspects of the remix are different?
- Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

Now that we have completed the technical HTML/CSS/JS portion of our learning, reflect also on these questions:

- How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1? 
- Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

Next Monday we will begin to look at Twine, a popular platform for creating branching, choose-your-own-adventure style literature. In advance of this, think about what story you would like to tell, that could make use of Twine's branching mode of storytelling. You may already have an unpublished work-in-progress on your hard drive, or maybe you will be inspired to create something new.
 
# Wednesday 19th March (for use in class and reading after class)

## Defining Electronic Literature

Edit the `readings.md` page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions below. Answer these questions with reference to Week 1 & 2 readings (you can include anything from week 3 if you wish but W1&2 are probably most relevant). This passage should be 500 - 750 words. 

- What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?
- How are those elements meaningful?
- How are the works read differently from print literature?
- How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

## Algorithm and Constraint

## Questions: 
- What is an algorithm? What is a constraint? 
- Can you think of ways you might already be using thesein your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and sytematise the way you write)?
- Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
- How does algorthmic writing make us think differently about authorship? 

### Pen and Paper

Use pen and paper in applying the following processes and constraints. Take a photo of the results or transcribe them and add them to your folio.

#### To Make a Dadaist Poem

Follow the instructions for Tristan Tzara's ["To Make a Dadaist Poem"](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html).

#### Lipograms

Rewrite a very short piece of writing for each of the following constraints:

- The letter e
- Any other letter
- All the following letters: b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, and y (prisoner's constraint)

#### Mesostics

Decide on a mesostic word. Rewrite a short piece of writing using this word as the spine word.

#### N+7

Replace every noun in a short piece of writing with the seventh noun that is found after it in a dictionary.

Vary this technique (e.g. N+9).

#### Constraint and Process

- Create a constraint (a restriction on your writing such as not using a letter (lipogram) or using a set number of syllables)
- Create a process (a process for creating writing such as picking the third word of each page of a book)

### Code

#### Remix "To Make a Dadaist Poem"

- If you haven't done so already, create a [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) account by signing up with your GitHub account and link your GitHub account
- Select "Remix on Glitch" on ["To Make a Dadaist Poem"](https://to-make-a-dadaist-poem.glitch.me)
- Create a repository in GitHub for the remix
- Change the article text (use your own text, text from a newspaper article or from a book on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/))
- Change the line length
- Export to GitHub after each change
- For your final assessment, add a link to your Glitch project in your digital writing folio

#### Remix N+7 
<ins>*Optional exercise as we didn't get through it in class.</ins>

- Select "Remix on Glitch" on ["N+7"](https://n-plus-7.glitch.me)
- Create a repository in GitHub for the remix
- Change the article text
- Change the difference in number of nouns
- Export to GitHub after each change
- For your final assessment, add a link to your Glitch project in your digital writing folio

### Taroko Gorge(s)
<ins>*Optional exercise as we didn't get through it in class.</ins>

Select a remixed [Taroko Gorge](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/) and edit the `exercises.md` page in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions:

- What aspects of the remix are the same?
- What aspects of the remix are different?
- Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

# Week 4 - for use in class

## Monday 24th March

Please note that your first assessment has a new due date. Presentations will take place during class next Monday the 31st, however **you are expected to upload your slide presentation onto Canvas by this Friday 28th March 11.59pm**. If you require an extension, you must apply for an extension through the Canvas portal.

Last week when we deployed our coding playgrounds using GitHub pages we ran into errors. Jenny has thoroughly investigated this and the issue is related to certain JavaScript functionality around "event listeners", which we use frequently in digital poetics but which in real world (aka capitalism and the vectors of communication run by tech oligarchs) carry the potential for security risks. Our poems, however, pose no security risks to us, and so the way to get around this will be to create an account with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using your GitHub credentials. Other options for free website deployment include [Render](https://render.com/) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Jenny will demonstrate in class how to then deploy your coding playground website through Vercel. Knowing how to do this will make life easy later, when it comes time to publish our Twine stories and websites.

Today we will focus on learning Twine, a user-friendly platform for writing interactive fiction. Jenny will begin with a 1990s example of pioneering hypertext fiction before sharing contemporary examples of Twine stories published in literary journals, and Lucinda will follow up in the Wednesday class with student examples so you'll have an idea of the level of work you might be expected to produce. 

### 1990s hypertext narrative example

- [my body – a Wunderkammer](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/jackson__my_body_a_wunderkammer.html)

Please refer to our class [Twine resources](/resources-twine.md) throughout the semester as we continue to learn new Twine functionality bit by bit. You can also refer to Twine's official [basic concepts documentation](https://twinery.org/reference/en/getting-started/basic-concepts.html).

If you are missing the Monday class, you will need to follow the instructions in the class [Twine resources](/resources-twine.md) up to the section on [changing the story stylesheet](/resources-twine.md#change-the-story-stylesheet). We will continue learning Twine functionality on Monday 7th April - with a focus on background images/scaling images/adding audio - and Monday 14th when we will learn how to insert image maps into Twine before we move onto Bitsy games.

The following peer-reviewed article is not at all required reading, but if you choose to use Twine for your final project, you may be insterested in reading about how Mia Francesca-Jones used [Twine as a tool to expand life writing practice about place and space](https://textjournal.scholasticahq.com/article/57762).

Tips for Ass 1 Case Study Presentation 

### Assessment Criteria - Content: (40%) ###

**Assignment Instruction**: Prepare a case study of a work of electronic literature. How does it work? What does it do? How does the reader interact with the piece? What kinds of questions does it raise for you?  

Tip: Lead with interest and curiosity. It’s ok to have questions about E-Lit theory and practice at this early stage it’s complex! Don’t feel you need to know it all.

**Assignment Instruction**: You should include an analysis of form, to offer your lab group some context.

Tip: This is not a 3000 word essay and so you won’t be able to go into enormous detail in your analysis. In fact I have removed the word 'detailed' from this instruction. Make sure you know the case study very well (in detail) but choose only the most relevant points in your analysis. You don’t have time to outline everything there is to say about it. 

**Assignment Instruction**: Your presentation should briefly address ‘What is conveyed’ by the digital work and tell us something about the artist and where the artist sits in terms of industry or material practice.

Tip: Use specific terms from the field: remixed, kinetic, hypertextual essaying and poetry, interactive fiction, programmatic texts - the readings are full of great lists of the hybridity and diversity of form, use them to help you if you are not sure about the terminology. Locate it in the field: ‘Generational’ definers will be helpful here. This is where you should include some refrences to the Required Readings from Weeks 1-3. E-Lit is full of hybridity. These texts can not be clearly pinned down as belonging to one type. Is it on the spectrum of a game/story? E-Lit/Digital Art? what kind of hybridity does it present? (as relevant).
This point from the Week 3 Reading by Memmott (2006 p.293) is useful to think about (you don’t need to provide a long reference like this I just thought I’d point it this out FYI)  

- “These terms are liquid delimiters for creative cultural practice through applied technology. The context in which any given term is used provides the framework for its definition, however tentative or temporary. The terms are conveniences—(perhaps) for the sake of argument.”

**Assignment Instruction**: You should then spend most of your time unpacking 'How does it happen?' whatever it is that this digital work does. Ask yourself: how a reader interacts with the work or whether they can; the relationship between imagery and text; how the text changes between readings; how movement acts in the work; the structure of the work; the technologies used; the relationship between space and time in the work (explicit or implicit); the relationship between the work and the browser. 

Tip: You will need to understand the case study well enough to make relevant  choices here about the most important aspects that back up your understanding of the work and how it is informing your own practice.  

**Assignment Instruction**: Share with us what you have learnt that might relate to your own practice or potential output.

Tip: Remember to tell us about your own practice - how does this case study relate? This is a really important and one of the most interesting part of the assignment. Bring it back to your own practice.  

**Assignment Instruction**: Please leave the class with 1 question at the end of the talk. The question should be open-ended and meant to make us think about our own practice, making or reading digital literature.

Tip: There are so many interesting questions that E-Lit raises: what are the most relevant and pressing for the way you think about your own practice of making and reading? 

### Assessment Criteria - Use of supporting materials (20%) ###
**Assignment Instruction**: Support materials are essential - a clear Powerpoint presentation so we can follow along.

Tip: Using presentation materials in a sophisticated way means making considered choices about what you say verbally, and what you show visually, and using the strengths of both mediums. Remember the cliché “a picture says a thousand words” – use visuals to show things that would take a lot of words to describe. Equally,  presentation slides should not be loaded with text. A few wordy slides is fine but don’t try to fit an essay onto a Powerpoint. Any presentation platform you can submit to canvas is fine. You don't have to use Powerpoint.

### Assessment Criteria - Delivery: (20%) and Volume and Clarity of Expression (10%) ###

Tip: lead with interest and curiosity. If you are interested and curious your audience is very likely to be also. 

Tip: Speak at a moderate speed. A rule of thumb is 100 words a minute. 

Tip: Prepare. Rehearse and time yourself.  

Tip: make sure it runs to time: aim for 4 be done by 4.30. You will be timed and stopped at 5mins.


## Week 5 

## Monday class Assessment 1 Case Study Presesentations

## Wednesday April 2

Hypertext fiction: concepts, precursors, critical framing. Below are some links and references to assist your thinking and understanding of hypertext.
As we have learned, hypertext was one of the first innovations in E-Literature and remains an important aspect of this diverse field.

Print Precursors: 
- Marc Saporta, Composition No. 1 (1961)
- Vladimir Nabokov, Pale Fire (1962)
- Julio Cortázar, Hopscotch (1963)
- BS Johnson, The Unfortunates (1969)
- Choose Your Own Adventure (1979–1998)

Technological Precursors (not neccessarily literary)
- Memex, Vannevar Bush, ["As We May Think" 1945](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)
- Hypertext, Ted Nelson, 1965

- HyperCard, 1987
- World Wide Web, 1989

Contemporary Publisher [Eastgate Systems](http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/Fiction.html)
  
### Reading 
**Requirement for final folio - 350-500 words on the below (this can be done any time this week)**

This week's Required Reading (Aarseth 1997) unpacks some territory that speak directly to some of the great questions raised in your Case Study presnetations such as "in what sense can a hypertext be a narrative? Is hypertext a literary genre or a literary technique?" It introduces the important concept of "ergotics": "hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it, as I try to demonstrate through the concept of ergodics." (p.95)

- What do you think of Aarseth's concept? explain how it offer an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?

Regarding our discussion about new terms and concents for thinking beyond binaries: author/reader text/audience ficion/fact etc, and genres or 'silos': novel, poetry, essay, memoir, literature, art, game etc    
- deleuze and the 'rhizome' from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)) I will add an optional extended reading for anyone interesting in this idea
- new media art [rhizome.org](https://rhizome.org)

  ### In Class

- How could you plan hypertext fiction?
- Discusion: online tools for mapping stories
- [miro.com](miro.com) available to RMIT students log in with your student password. 
- [scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAABYPNyhuSKVFV_EYVKtXYztrYNeWk&gclid=Cj0KCQjwna6_BhCbARIsALId2Z2XTfatmm5zKm76D9jSH9rBvDwzH0CrcyRPTO2ObyDn2WwTpS2NlG0aAgsfEALw_wcB) is a popular tool for writers that has a cork board function
- [padlet.com](https://padlet.com/)this is like an online post-it note board you should have a student login for this also  

- ### Toward Assessment 2
- Proposals discussion and reflections in folio **Required Activity for Final Folio**
  
- What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment 2 and 3
- What platform and technology does it require?
- Do you know already if you can make it?
- What else do you need to learn in order to execute your vision for this piece?
- **map your thoughts any way you like - use miro, use a corkboard, a table in a word doc, ppowerpoint, post it notes, whatever. If you use a physical medium take photos and pop them in a sharefolder linked to your Github folio.** 

## Week 6

## Monday class - 7th April

Today we will begin class with any remaining Assessment 1 Case Study Presesentations.

Please be prepared to discuss how you are tracking with the class and the coursework so far. Think about what tools you need to do your main project for the class. 

Today we will continue our work with Twine - beginning with [inserting audio](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-twine.md#adding-audio) and then continuing on with styling images. 

If there is time today, we will cover [image maps in Twine](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-twine.md#image-maps), however, we can slow down to address any tech challenges that people are facing so far. If you feel uncertain about anything, chances are that other people are having the same difficulty. Please make sure to ask questions now, so that you have ample time to prepare for the second Assessment.

If you miss class today, please be sure to follow along learning about audio, image styling and image maps using the [Twine resources](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-twine.md). You can follow along with this [video recording](https://www.loom.com/embed/8ec5d97f6c1c4683adec6439049d33f2?sid=f0d64dfd-6e97-484c-9383-fd4b16670fdc) which walks you through the process step-by-setp. **You will be expected to make a minimum effort with image styling, audio and image maps in Twine for your folio, even if you do not choose Twine as the platform for your project.** 

Once we have completed a test image map - basic is okay, no need to overdo it! - then if you have attended all the classes so far and/or have otherwise kept up with the learning, the good news is that there is no more **required** new technology for you to learn. 

**Next Monday the tech content around writing games using platforms such as Bitsy and Inform 7 is optional. If you do not include those in your portfolio, you will not be penalised.** 

As we continue progressing towards Assessments 2 and 3, we will work with the tech tools that we have already been exposed to. There will be time during future classes, for example, for us to complete the author website portion of the folio requirement. 

## Wednesday class - 9th April

**Toward Assessment 2 (and 3) activity and discussion** 
1. See the slide deck on Canvas modules [Student Works 2024](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/146513/pages/student-works-2024?module_item_id=7255750). These are three successful examples of developed digital works and they are all very different. 
 
2. Critically reflect on these works by asking the same sort of questions as you asked of the case study Ass 1:
- How does it work? What does it do? How does the reader interact with the piece? What is conveyed by the digital work?
- How does the digital affordance work with the piece’s themes? Does its function deepen the meaning and interpretation of the themes for you as a reader? 
- Think about: the relationship between imagery and text; how the text changes between readings; how movement acts in the work; the structure of the work; the technologies used.
- How does this work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece? **Requirement for final folio write 250 to 300 (minimum) words on this (can be done any time this week)** 

3. See the slide deck on Canvas modules [Jenny's Final Project](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/146513/pages/jennys-final-project-2021)
- Read the contextual statements and consider how the form and function of each aspect of this piece feeds into the themes of the work.
- See the map of Jenny's Twine story on Slide 8. How might you map your own emerging ideas? (If you have not already done the mapping exrcise from last week please catch up on this.)  
 

## Week 7

### Monday class – 14th April

Today we will look at interactive fiction in games. You are not required to include games code from today in your folio. We understand that you have experimented with so much code already. 

We will play through a number of Bitsy examples (which will be added to the repo later) and reflect on the affordances of tiny games.

#### Class discussion

- How does Bitsy's technical constraint of 8x8 pixel art and limited colour palettes affect narrative possibilities and expression? In particular, how have these been used to elicit emotional response to themes around memory and grief?
- In what ways do spatial navigation and environmental storytelling function differently in Bitsy games compared to other e-lit forms? What does this ask of the reader/player?
- How can we make use various game features (e.g., character interactions triggering text, having scenes “loop” differently with each subsequent play) to make a game “literary”, with a compelling emotional timbre?

We will play with the online Bitsy Game Maker, drawing upon our new [games resources page](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-games.md). You can follow Jenny's recorded [Bitsy tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/e02adc5163c8433fa6a99305d3ffc010?sid=c63d4bd8-a9bd-4256-9fae-0ffcf9b2e589) for the basics of editing a Bitsy game and publishing through GitHub pages.

Jenny has also recorded a quick [video tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/f51ed2514a8d404c9e4902d5e52f1fe6?sid=6c48a75c-cd04-4725-a597-9185de2251c1) that will take you through the through the [instructions for Inform 7](/resources-games.md#inform-7).

Since [Assessment Two](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/class-handbook.md#task-2-proposal-25) is coming up, think about whether there is any tech that you need to know to make your creative prototype for your presentation. We will have time in class today to troubleshoot any of the coding that we have covered so far. 

### Wednesday class – 16th April

Assessment 2 is happening as soon as we come back from the Mid Term break. Please ensure that you have done the activities from Wednesday classes Weeks 5 and 6 this will really help you develop your concept and plans.

Today's class will be a working session. I would really like to see everyone's concept/story mapping so far (see week 5 activity) and plans toward Ass 2, including an achievable list of things to do over the break. Jenny and I won't be available for trouble shooting as we will be on leave so it's important you plan out what you need to do and contingencies for what you will present. 

[Here](https://forms.office.com/r/hgARSa0LLc) is a feedback form that we would really appreciate you filling out. You can tell us how you are going and anything specific you need to realise your goals and ideas in the second part of semester.

Assessment 1 Results are now released and so you'll be able to make a point of taking on this feedback for your second presentation. 

## Mid-semester break - key notes

**Mollie made a [discord server](https://discord.gg/HEmnrkEBGZ) for the students in our class, come say hi!**
You and your classmates have so much knowledge which you can pool together. The hive mind is capable of great things, including sourcing coding solutions. Keep in touch with one another over break, share your challenges and your breakthroughs. Jenny and Lucinda will be on leave over mid-semester break, so your cohort will be your best resource for working things out. Keep track of anything that cannot be solved by the hive mind, as we will dedicate class time - likely on the Mondays in Weeks 10, 11 and 12 - to troubleshooting code and finding solutions to realise your projects. 

**Very important: Please make sure that you follow the [assessment brief](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/class-handbook.md#task-2-proposal-25) which is published in this GitHub repo, as it tailors the general assessment requirement, listed in Canvas, to Digital Writing specifically.**

## Week 8

### Monday class – 28th April
Assessment 2 presentations.

### Wednesday class - 30th April
Today in class we will work through reflective and mapping exercises help you confirm the scope of your piece, and identify key tasks that you need to develop and resolve it. Your final work must be a complete work, not a prototype, with ideas that have been introduced, developed and resolved.

In Assessment 2 you have introduced these ideas. Our activity today will help you to identify what needs to be developed and how to resolve your piece within the timeframe you have got. 

The length/scope/scale of the work must be clarified and confirmed by the end of this week.

**Reflection on Feedback and Peer Presentations Required activity for final folio (can be completed anytime this week)**

What has been **introduced?** Summarise your proposed piece
- What are the themes and ideas is your piece is exploring?:
- What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic? 
- succinctly: What is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece? 
- what do you wish there reader to understand of feel? 

What needs to be **developed?**

- what drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
- how does the digital feed into this momentum? 
- how does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the piece’s thematics?

- do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to answer the above questions? how will you do this? By mapping? By writing it out?
  
**Exercise**
Now you have introduced your piece and some prototype pages, it can be a good idea to step off the digital platform and fully scope your ideas through writing, or drawing, or a simple form of digital mapping (like Miro). Something that gives you some flow away from the tech.

Here is a [template you might like to use](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVI86sGI4=/?share_link_id=919709815169)(PASSWORD: template) This is adapted from a Design Thinking tool that puts the audience experience within the concept development. Also in [PDF on Canvas print it out in A3 (A4 will be too small)](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/146513/files/45263627?module_item_id=7301579) 

You need to find the edges of your piece to know how much you need to do to develop and resolve it. That means drafting/mapping the whole thing if you have not done so already **at this stage it is important that this is done in detail**. You can use the template above or another kind of map. If you use a physical medium take photos and pop them in a sharefolder linked to your Github folio. Quite a few people showed how they are usin colour coding in miro to think through the different threads of their pieces. 

Once you have further mapped/drafted you piece, ask yourself what do you need to do to **resolve** it?

Scope and Scale
- how many words will it be?
- how many screens?
- what do you need to do on a week-by-week basis (is this realistic?)
- what is the tech that might get you stuck? what is the workaround/Plan B?
- what else might be an obstacle? flag it early with Jenny and Lucinda 


## Week 9

### Monday class – 5th May
Any remaining Assessment 2 presentations.

Today we will focus on making author websites in Glitch using an easy-to-use template built by Jenny with the help of ChatGPT. We will publish our author sites through GitHub, assigning them the URL `username.github.io`, much like Jenny's author website is on [jennyhedley.github.io](https://jennyhedley.github.io/). If you miss class, you can read about how to [publish to your github.io page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart#creating-your-website).

Here is the [website which you can edit for your own purposes](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-author-website). You may also create your own design from scratch or with the help of AI.

#### Very important video notice re Publishing Your Coding Playground & Fixing ./style.css directory issues

We will cover the content from this video in class, however, if you miss class please [watch this 5-minute clip](https://www.loom.com/share/91e6eb98cfc2460bbc279f62951813fe?sid=2f21ca10-14c1-4d12-995b-51612a0aed1a). This video covers an important fix to the stylesheet directory which anticipates our work today building author websites and publishing them through GitHub pages. This is a coding solution you will want to be mindful of across any of your HTML/CSS projects published through GitHub, which involves changing the code in the `<head>` of your `index.html` file from `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" />` to `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />`. The dot before the `/style.css` becomes very important as soon as you claim your `username.github.io` webpage!

It is a requirement that you have published your version of the coding playground - which we worked on in Weeks 1–3 - and included it in your [Assessment 3 folio which you should familiarise yourself with now](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/folio-requirements.md#assessment-3---folio-requirements). You will need to include the URL of both your GitHub repository for the playground, and one link either to the deployed site which you've published through GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify or other free host. Same for your author website, main project and other coding experiments. 

In previous years, people have lost marks on the final assessment where they have said things like "I don't know how to publish my site". The multiple video recordings, such as the one above and the Twine image maps video that shows you how to create and publish a Twine project, are designed to help you overcome such hurdles. If you need a video recording of any other specific knowledge, please request it in advance. We will not be available for consultation beyond the final class on Wednesday 28th May so figure out what you need to know asap.

### Wednesday class – 7th May
Any remaining Assessment 2 presentations.

Today we will continue work on the creative development of your piece. You will work in small groups to workshop your concept and prototype pages asking your peers to consider the same questions you considered yourself last week:

- What are the themes and ideas the piece is exploring? 
- what drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
- how does the digital feed into this momentum?
- what suggestions can you make for the reader experience? 

**Requirement for final folio (200 words minimum - can be done any time this week)** 
Update your folio with a summary and reflection on the feedback you recieved and dot points for next steps with planned dates for doing it.  

## Week 10

### Monday class – 12th May

Today we will spend the first two-plus hours of class troubleshooting common errors and making sure you have the tools you need to meet the requirements of the folio. Please bring to class any issues that you are having with your code, so that we can work together to problem-solve. If there is anything that we cannot solve together, provided that you send me aka Jenny a link to your code asap, I will research possible solutions for you.

You are welcome to take breaks as needed during class and to work in small groups to take advantage of the hive mind. This will be especially useful if you know people are using similar code to you.

Next Monday we will meet in class at 2.30pm as usual and run through an hour of troubleshooting before we walk over to 8.4.13 together for the showcase which runs from 3.30–5pm.

**Note re Wednesday drop-in sessions for troubleshooting**

Jenny will be approximately 10 minutes late to the final three Wednesday 5.15pm drop-in sessions due to parenting demands, and will keep the meetings open at least 10 minutes later, until 6.25pm, to accommodate troubleshooting. 

Please take advantage of these sessions as Jenny will only be available for consultation through the Wednesday drop-in session of Week 12. Please be mindful that Jenny is employed as a casual, short-term academic and is not contracted to work beyond Wednesday 28th May except for a specific number of marking hours to grade assessments.

**Today from 4.45pm: structured time to plan the Horizons showcase which will take place during class next Monday**

Showcase Location: 008.004.013  Each class has 30 minutes. There are heaps of tables in the room so it would be great to bring laptops and have WIP pieces available for people to test and play with.
 
Now: showcase preparation is the first activity in the reflective phase of the course where you can begin to identify and articulate key insights and learning that has happened for you.

Reflection Activity 1: (document this activity in your GitHub, these notes will be helpful for developing your final critical reflection too)

5 - 7 mins: Make some quick and dirty reflective notes: 

- what were your expectations coming into the class and what have you learnt? 
- how has your creative writing practice developed? are there new directions? Or perhaps it has confirmed something about your practice as it was? 
- what particular aspects of code-based writing and E-Lit might inform your practice from here on? Perhaps you will take an aspect of E-Lit into an analogue space? Perhaps you will never go near code ever again!

Showcase presentation idea - drawing on your reflections, perhaps everyone reads one line of a collective collage work made up of expectations from week 1 and current reflections on learning. This is just a suggestion but it could be fun. We can finalise on Wednesday. 

These are your expectations from Week 1:
- Understanding what’s happening in the digital space as an analogue person
- Where does DW intersect with current technologies and how can we use these to augment writerly works?
- Curious to learn new things
- What even is software development and coding?
- How can we take writing (an old technology) into a contemporary space?
- Learning about possibilities of form, especially concrete poetry
- How does writing in code look on the page?
- Developing skills: CSS, custom coding beyond basics especially in poetry space
- Where will the formatting take our writing?
- Interactive elements
- Learning to upgrade writing skills in digital world
- Experimenting with form
- Interactive fiction, digital entropy, impermanence
- Moving out of comfort zone, past the Word doc
- How do different digital elements change the way someone experiences a work
- How can the audience interact with and alter the meaning of the poem?
- How can DW break boundaries and rules of analogue? How can we then break DW rules?

### Wednesday class – 14th May

Assessment 3 Folio Requirements: Q&A and run through details. 
- What needs to be in the PDF? What needs to be in the GitHub repo? 
- 2024 exemplars
- If you wish to include a CV instead of, or as well as, your personal website [RMIT jobshop](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/jobs-careers-employability/career-connect) can help you write one.

Reflection Activity 2: Preparation for Horizons showcase. Here is one idea: [collective presentation score](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ufpVlpm32YW4uVl108ipwqBu3vm6ma-9LltoOtXvRtE/edit?usp=sharing). OR Mollie has sugested these reflective prompts that a few of you could respond to: 

Discuss how you came to be a part of the Digital Writing Studio and why you chose it.
- Why did you choose this studio?
- What knowledge did you possess of digital writing/interactive fiction prior to this studio?
- What were you excited about learning or furthering your knowledge on?
- What were you worried about when joining this studio?
 
Discuss what we learnt about and what interested you.
- Were there any portions of the class that stood out to you?
- Was there anything that you were able to expand your prior knowledge on?
- You can discuss your case study here if you would like to.
 
Discuss your final project and how it may relate back to your initial interests in the class or what we have learnt.
- What has inspired your final project?
- What knowledge from this studio are you using to create this final project?
 
Discuss how this studio has impacted your writing practice.
- Is interactive fiction something that you will continue to do after this studio?
- Has learning about and experimenting with interactive fiction influenced how you approach writing as a whole?

These prompts also serve as a good place to begin jotting ideas toward 500 words for Ass 3. 

## Week 11

### Monday class – 19th May

Today we will spend the first hour of class troubleshooting tech issues. If you are using Twine and have not embedded images yet, test this out asap. People commonly have directory issues that need to be worked through.

Also make sure your project is published using GitHub Pages as this is how Lucinda and Jenny will view your project during marking. Test that it looks/plays as expected. 

Please remember that Jenny is available for tech support through Week 12 (next week) only and the last class is Wednesday 28th May. Jenny will attend this Wednesday 28th class to provide last-minute tech support and will wrap up with the evening drop-in session from 5.25-6.25pm. Jenny cannot guarantee availability to offer tech support on the 29th/30th due to full-time study so get in early. Email your problems/screenshot issues so that they sit in our inboxes and we will get to them as soon as time permits.

Today we will walk over to 8.4.13 together for the Horizons showcase which runs from 3.30–5pm.

### Wednesday class – 21st May

Today is a working session on both your final pieces and folios. In class Lucinda will be consulting on folio development and the structural and literary elements of your pieces. If you wish to work from home Lucinda can provide feedback through a screengrab video - please email any questions. It's important at this stage that your developing works are published through Gihhub pages or at least that the code is pushed to a repo on Github so we can view the work. We'll be checking this over the next week to make sure everyone is on track on this point and no one has a panic on the day of submission because they can't publish. Remember both Lucinda and Jenny will be overseas in week 13 and not immedately contactable. In class today we will also troubleshoot common problems. We are finding that people are coming up against a lot of the same issues. Jenny has added these solutions to the Twine Resources page. 

## Week 12 (final week of class)

Thank you to Mollie for letting us know about [Glitch's post](https://blog.glitch.com/post/changes-are-coming-to-glitch/) stating that they will begin shutting down hosting services on 8th July. The post indicates:

- Your Glitch dashboard will be available through the end of 2025 with code downloads for all of your projects

Your projects will be assessed before the planned shutdown so if you built yours using Glitch this will not affect your project for grading purposes. 

Thankfully all of you will have your project code backed up in your GitHub repositories, so you will not lose your projects. The worse-case scenario is that if you uploaded all of your images and files to Glitch using the "assets" function, then the image URLs will break at whatever stage Glitch stops hosting images.

To remedy this (should you wish for any Glitch projects to live on beyond this course, e.g. your artist websites), [Jenny posted a 5-minute video](https://www.loom.com/share/4558e257703845b1b4c204aa667c187f?sid=c69d3f4d-a805-4d2b-b290-0c3223751129) demonstrating how to download your project, create an `img` folder for images (this is how we usually label it in HTML), transfer images there, update using VS Code and push to your repo using GitHub Desktop. **Remember to make sure your images are not too big because the max file size is around 25mb in the free GitHub repositories.** If you are using up 25mb the final "push" shown in the video could take several minutes.

We can also revisit this and any other tech questions in class Wednesday, since both Jenny and Lucinda will be there.

## Course Experience Survey - Open now

Please take time in class to complete the CES.

The CES has launched and we invite you to give feedback which will help shape future iterations of this course. Visit [this link](https://bit.ly/cesrmit) to let RMIT know what you thought of the learning experience, the online content, what you loved and what you'd change. The link closes on 8th June. *Take the survey asap and you'll be entered into a weekly draw where you can win a $500 voucher.*

## Reminder re final folio

Read the overview of Assessment 3 in the [course handbook](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/class-handbook.md#task-3-folio-including-a-developed-creative-work-50).

Remember to [attach/start with a cover sheet](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/coversheet-for-developed-creative-work.md) for your developed creative work.

The [folio requirements are laid out here](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/folio-requirements.md).

You can read the [rubric on Canvas](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/146513/assignments/1050257), but most of that generalised assessment description doesn't relate specifically to our lab.

Where the rubric talks about the folio, please remember that your final digital project is a major part of that folio. Beyond the stated required documents, it is up to you to decide how you want to showcase your learning throughout the semester. We are looking for evidence of sustained engagement (with in-class exercises, some of the readings, the required reflections). You don't need to reflect on every single reading; there are not required reflections across all weeks. We won't be nitpicky and counting words. We expect that some exercises/reflections will be more generative for you than others - that's fine. Beyond the required folio items, it's up to you how to use the remainder of the 15-30 pages. 

**Regarding the assessment criteria:**

- **Objectives and Evidence** - We are looking (in both your PDF folio and your GitHub repositories/Pages links) for a well-developed final project with evidence of its development. We are looking also for your engagement with early experiments (e.g., the coding playground), which shouldn't be perfect. We will look in your repositories to see evidence of your many commits over time. If you've put in the hours and made an effort with the various technologies, it will be clear. 
- **Annotations and Reflection** - The required critical reflections and reflection on practice will cover this criteria. If you include screenshots in your folio, you might wish to annotate them to tell us why you've included them (if it's not obvious). Your reflections can be in your PDF folio or in your GitHub repo or both, so long as you point us to where they are.
- **Presentation** - If you use the cover sheet, provide clear links to the GitHub repositories and GitHub pages for your project/author website/experiments, include the reflections/exercises in some logical order, and annotate where anything is unclear, then great! No need to waste time on fancy styling or pro-level formatting - clear, logical and easy to read (e.g., a standard 12 pt font) is all we ask.
- **Referencing** - You can include any references for the required in-class readings and reflections alongside your readings/reflections, or you can include a reference list at the end of your folio. Reference style is APA 7. You may wish to consult this [referencing guide](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library/study/referencing/apa-7#reference-list).

## Final drop-in session online tonight 5.15 Wednesday May 28

Just reminding you that tonight at 5.15 is the last session for any tech support from Jenny. Both Jenny and Lucinda be online tonight for the final drop in session.

After tonight, if you are having tech issues with your story you must resolve them yourself, or hand it in as-is and include reflections on any problems that are unresolved. (In this reflection you should include the reason why it was not possible to resolve it within the 60 hours of class time allocated plus the additional 12 hours of drop in sessions.)

The Teams Link for tonight is above in the introduction section of README.md

**Until June 6 Lucinda is on email for emergency submission questions.**
