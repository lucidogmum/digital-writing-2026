# CLASS HANDBOOK

## Digital Writing

### With Jenny Hedley and Lucinda Strahan

This studio focuses on electronic/digital writing – that is, writing (poetry, fiction, nonfiction or other) that relies on computation to be realised. This includes computer-generated writing, hypertext and interactive fiction, and digital poetry. We will also look at print precursors that use techniques associated with digital literature (for example, the processes employed by the Oulipo writers). We will explore interactive literary concepts, such as what it means when readers can make choices in a narrative or move the words in a poem, and how to use these techniques to develop or alter your work.

There is no requirement to have any skills in relation to the digital – in other words, you don't need to be a programmer – but you must be willing to challenge yourself and be bold. Over the semester we will read a range of digital literature and there will be opportunities to make works with authoring tools like Twine, which require little knowledge, to writing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. At the end of semester, you will produce either an interactive narrative work or a series of digital poems and understand the processes involved in publishing these works online.

This studio is for those who wish to experiment with their writing practice and take a more conscious approach to the tools with which they write, or those interested in form and its possibilities and constraints.

## Note about email contact, consultation and enquiries outside of class

Please feel free to email us about Equitable Learning Plans, any circumstances that require extensions or anything that’s getting in the way of your studies. If you have technical issues there will be time for trouble shooting in class - please be mindful that your issue is likely to be the same issue for others so sharing it in class time is the best thing for everyone. Please use the Github and online resources as well as your peers to find answers to your questions.
